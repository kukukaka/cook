#Super meat balls

The first recipe is a personal favourite from my mum's cookbook. Easy and fast to cook, these meatballs are maybe not the fanciest food for a romantic dinner, but they are tasty and can feed a village.


The meatballs themselves are easy to prepare. The main mix is minced beef meat and minced onion. We add some beaten egg, salt, parsley and white bread soaked in milk, and mix everything with our own hands. Quantities may vary depending taste, but meat should be the star here. Once we divide the mix in compact balls, I always go for a three big bites size, we just have to cover them with breadcrumbs and they are ready for the frying pan. If you live in London, you will probably need to add an extra step to find proper fine crumbs; but yes, London.


Sauce. Use some of the minced onion left from the meatballs in a saucepan (or in the same frying pan you used for the meatballs) and add some diced carrot too. Cook it with a bit of oil for some minutes at medium-low heat and then add breadcrumbs with white wine and water. Achieving a dense sauce requires some attention, and we will need to play with the correct combination of salt, breadcrumb and liquid.


Once the sauce has nice texture and flavour serve it and then put the meatballs above. Nice digestion.
